To evaluate a webconference, responsibles must analyse the existing recordings to, then, evaluate the student. However, during the execution of the assignment, the student or group of students may schedule and record one or more webconferences. These webconferences may be used, for example, to meetings between group members, to tests, to practice etc. That is, not all webconferences scheduled and recorded need, necessarily, be used to evaluation. <br/><br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;To inform the responsible wich ones of the webconferences must be used to evaluation, the student can define one or more as Final Version.  That way, the responsible will be able to evaluate only the webconferences defined as final version within all the ones scheduled and/or recorded.
